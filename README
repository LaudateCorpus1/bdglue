“Big Data Glue” (a.k.a. BDGlue) was developed as a general purpose library 
for delivering data from Java applications into various Big Data targets 
in a number of different data formats. The idea was to create a “one stop 
shop” of sorts to facilitate easy exploration of different technologies to 
help users identify what might be the most appropriate approach in any 
particular case. The overarching goal was to allow this experimentation to 
occur without the user having to write any Big Data-specific code. 
Big Data targets include Flume, Kafka, HDFS, Hive, HBase, Oracle NoSQL, 
Cassandra, and others. BDGlue processes data captured in real-time by 
Oracle GoldenGate from relational database sources.

To build this project, 

   git clone https://github.com/bdglue/bdglue

simply type "make" from the command line. 

You will need to configure two environment variables:

* GGBD_HOME is the directory where GG for Big Data in installed. For 
  example, if GG for Big Data is installed at /u01/ggbd12_2, then you 
  would set GGBD_HOME=/u01/ggbd12_2.
* GGBD_VERSION is an environment variable set to the version of the 
  ggdbutil-VERSION.jar file found in the GGBD_HOME/ggjava/resources/lib 
  directory.  For example, if the file is named ggdbutil-12.2.0.1.0.012.jar, 
  then you would set GGBD_VERSION=12.2.0.1.0.012.


Assumptions: gmake, gcc, Maven, and Java 1.8 are all installed and 
configured.
